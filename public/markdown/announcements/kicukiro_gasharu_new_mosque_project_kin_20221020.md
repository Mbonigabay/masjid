# Gahunda yo Kubaka Umusigiti Mushya

Daru Salam Mosque was built in 1991 and upgraded in 2016. The building measures 18 meters by 15 meters (about 270 to 350 square meters), with an area of 542 square meters (lot size), including the landscape. The main axis of the building rotates about 22Â° north to east, connecting it to the direction of the Kaaba in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. This project was updated in 2016 and ended in 2017 with 320 users as the capacity of our masdjid today, we find all the contributions to complete these works from the Islamic community. Today we are thinking about how we can upgrade to accommodate 1200 users and above the capacity with a store, a qor`an school, an administrative office, a mosque for women and men, business rooms and a rental office.
