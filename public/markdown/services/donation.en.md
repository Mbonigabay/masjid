In all the activities that we do here at the mosque, we need support and the ability to do it. Those who want to support us can do so through the following:

* Bring your donation to Daru Salam Gasharu Mosque
* Via MOMO pay: \*182\*8\*1\*500737\*inkunga# (RMC/daru salam)
* Or to the mosque account number: 000400694470731 (RMC /daru salam) in BK

Your donation will help us to continue to provide important services to our community, such as religious services, educational programs, social welfare services, and maintenance of our mosque and facilities.

Every donation, no matter how small, makes a difference. We appreciate your support in helping us to build a stronger and more vibrant Muslim community.

Thank you for your generosity!
